		  <h2>Chapter 1: Progression</h2>
		  <p class="intro">My name is Ryan Prinsen and I was born on June 6, 1983. I grew up on a small family farm in Wisconsin. We raised several types of animals including cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys. Along with that, we always had some dogs and a lot of barn <span id = "cats">_________</span> running around. For periods of time, we had a pet turkey, and there was a guinea hen that randomly showed up one day and called our farm home for several years.</p>
		
		  <p>The main focus of our farm, and how we made a living was milking <span id ="cows">________</span>. It was a lot of work, which was something I did not enjoy a lot during the time, but have come to miss as the years have passed. I have no doubt that the time taught me a great deal regarding work-ethic, which is something that has been of great benefit to me as an adult working in a warehouse. <span class="sentence">While I enjoy my current position, I think I have the potential to accomplish much more with the proper education.</span></p>
		
		  <p>My goal is to continue working for my current employer. I have worked for them since I was still a teenager, and they are assisting me in furthering my education. I would like to find a position with them where I can still work on some of the logistics-type things I already do while being able to take advantage of more of my skills, and perhaps something that offers more of a challenge. My current position does not provide much of a challenge to me as I have been doing it so long, I have mastered everything. That along with the fact that I am not getting any younger is what drove me to finally decide that I need to earn a <span id = "bachelors">________</span> degree.</p>
		 <p>
		  <p>While the goal is to stay with my current employer, I also believe that having a bachelor's degree will offer me some security in the unlikely event that I suddenly find myself unemployed. While I find that possibility highly unlikely as a result of personal performance, there obviously are things that could happen where that could occur. As I am not mobile, if they were to decide to move the warehouse to a different location too far away to commute, I would be forced to look elsewhere for employment. So while my goal is to gain an education to advance, it will also help to ensure that I have the possibility to find similar paying jobs within other companies. In the end, I am just excited to be challenging myself, learning new things, and for what the future <span id = "holds">________</span>.</p>
